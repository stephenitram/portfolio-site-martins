          <p>
            At Weststar Abuja, I designed and implemented a custom automotive
            parts order tracking system for the after-sales department using
            Microsoft Lists. This solution was tailored to streamline the
            tracking of customer parts orders, ensuring real-time visibility,
            accountability, and improved communication across teams. The tracker
            replaced manual and error-prone processes, resulting in a 40%
            increase in operational efficiency and the elimination of
            oversight-related errors. It featured automated status updates,
            user-friendly interfaces, and integration with existing
            workflows—empowering staff to manage orders with greater accuracy
            and speed. This project exemplifies how low-code tools like
            Microsoft Lists can be leveraged to deliver high-impact digital
            solutions that enhance service delivery and customer satisfaction in
            the automotive sector.

          </p>
          <p>
            At Weststar Abuja, I engineered a highly resilient network
            infrastructure that achieved 99.9% uptime by optimizing Sophos XG
            Firewall traffic routing configurations and implementing proactive
            ISP link monitoring strategies. This initiative was critical in
            ensuring uninterrupted business operations and enhancing overall IT
            service reliability. I utilized PRTG Network Monitor for real-time
            performance tracking and integrated command-line interface (CLI)
            monitoring for deeper diagnostics and faster response to anomalies.
            These tools enabled continuous visibility into network health,
            bandwidth usage, and potential points of failure—allowing for
            preemptive action before issues could impact users. This project not
            only improved network stability but also demonstrated the value of
            combining intelligent firewall configuration with robust monitoring
            practices to deliver enterprise-grade uptime and performance.

          <p>
            At the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) Headquarters in Abuja, I
            managed the national deployment of the IFS ERP infrastructure,
            overseeing critical components including the Database,
            Application/Web Servers, and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
            servers. This role demanded high-level expertise in enterprise
            systems administration, performance tuning, and secure data
            handling. Beyond infrastructure management, I led a nationwide
            training initiative, equipping over 300 employees with the skills
            needed to effectively utilize the IFS platform. This large-scale
            capacity-building effort significantly improved system usage
            efficiency, reduced operational bottlenecks, and enhanced data
            accuracy across departments. This project highlights my ability to
            manage complex IT ecosystems while driving digital literacy and
            adoption at scale—ensuring both technical stability and
            organizational readiness.

          </p>
          <p>
            At Weststar Abuja, I implemented a robust data protection strategy
            across all mobile devices by deploying BitLocker encryption and
            enabling OneDrive cloud backups. This initiative was designed to
            safeguard sensitive company data, ensure compliance with data
            security standards, and support seamless recovery in case of device
            loss or failure. By configuring BitLocker, I ensured full-disk
            encryption across the organization’s mobile endpoints, protecting
            data at rest from unauthorized access. Simultaneously, I integrated
            OneDrive for Business to automate secure cloud backups, enabling
            real-time file synchronization and recovery. This dual-layered
            approach significantly enhanced the company’s data resilience,
            reduced the risk of data breaches, and empowered staff with secure,
            mobile-friendly access to their work resources.

          <p>
            To strengthen network visibility and security at Weststar Abuja, I
            implemented and configured Sophos Access Points (APs), ensuring
            seamless integration with the existing Sophos XG Firewall
            infrastructure. This deployment provided centralized control,
            improved wireless coverage, and enabled real-time monitoring of all
            connected devices. By leveraging Sophos’ synchronized security
            ecosystem, I was able to enforce unified threat management policies
            across both wired and wireless networks. The integration allowed for
            granular traffic analysis, rogue device detection, and automated
            response to potential threats—significantly enhancing the
            organization’s cybersecurity posture. This project not only improved
            network transparency and control but also laid the foundation for
            scalable, secure wireless connectivity aligned with enterprise IT
            standards.

            At Weststar Abuja, I led the designed and implementation of an
            innovative mobile web platform aimed at enhancing customer
            engagement within the waiting area and customer lounge. This
            solution leveraged QR code technology to provide instant access to
            detailed information about displayed accessories, transforming
            passive showroom browsing into an interactive digital experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            By integrating responsive web design with strategically placed QR

            specifications, and promotional content directly from their mobile
            devices—without the need for staff assistance. This initiative not
            only improved customer satisfaction and product visibility but also

            While working with DabarObject and Weststar Abuja, I led the design

            Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), I created comprehensive user
            guides for the Madex 2.0 application. These guides were instrumental
            in simplifying onboarding and boosting user confidence, ultimately
            driving higher adoption rates across the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Weststar Abuja, I designed and implemented a suite of operational
            tools including Vehicle Health Cards, Vehicle Tags, and Movement Log
            Books. These tools streamlined vehicle tracking, maintenance
            logging, and movement authorization processes—resulting in improved

          <p>
            For Nature’s Trust Abuja, a premium organic skincare and haircare
            brand, I developed a cohesive visual identity that reflects the

            the design of a distinctive logo, product labels, and a suite of
            visual content tailored for social media platforms. The logo was
            crafted to embody the brand’s organic essence, while the product
            labels were designed with clarity, elegance, and regulatory
            compliance in mind—ensuring shelf appeal and consumer trust.
            Additionally, I created engaging and visually consistent social
            media content that helped boost brand recognition and customer
            engagement across digital channels. This project combined creative
            direction with strategic branding, resulting in a unified visual
            language that resonates with Nature’s Trust’s target audience and
            supports its market positioning as a trusted organic brand.
